### Updating Djinni bridging files

The bridging interface between Kotlin and C++ are defined in the djinni files under [djinni](../djinni). After modifying those files the new bridging code can be generated by running

```make clean djinni```

in the folder [djinni](../djinni). This generates the Kotlin bindings, the C++ header files as well as all the JNI glue code.
