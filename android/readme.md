## How to use

## How to build

Make sure you have all submodules initialized and updated. to do this use
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

### Updating Djinni bridging files

The bridging interface between Kotlin and C++ are defined in the djinni files under [djinni](../djinni). After modifying those files the new bridging code can be generated by running

```make clean djinni```

in the folder [djinni](../djinni). This generates the Kotlin bindings, the C++ header files as well as all the JNI glue code.

### Building the Android Library

The Android library can be opened as an Android Studio project in the [android](.) folder. Alternatively you can build the library using gradle from the command line using

```
./gradlew assemble
```

and you find the generated .aar library under build/outputs/aar/. For development, it is easiest to include this library directly as a module into a wrapping Android application project that can be run on a device.
